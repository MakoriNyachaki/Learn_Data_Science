## Data Types
#### String
* Used to store a collection of characters.
* Use " " or ' ' or  """ """ to create strings.
* A string is immutable.

#### Numbers
* Types: _int,_ _float,_ and _complex_
* Conversion: _complex(),_ _int(),_ and _float()_.
* Math operations in order: (), **, *, /, +, -

#### Handling inputs and outputs
* Use the _input(prompt)_ to take the input from the user.
* The entered input will be converted into a  string by default
* Use Python's inbuilt _print()_ function to print output.

## Data Types
#### Lists
* A list is mutable and ordered collection of items.
* Syntax: _list((1,2,3,4))_ or _[1,2,3,4]_

#### Tuples
* Is an immutable and ordered sequence.
* Syntax: _tuple((1,2,3))_ or _(1,2,3)_
* Are 0-based index just as lists.

#### Dictionaries
* A dictionary is a mutable key value pairs to store a collection.
* Syntax: _{key:value}_ or _dict({key:value})_

#### Sets
* A set is unordered and immutable collection.
* They do not support duplicates.
* Syntax: _{1,2,3}_ or _set([1,2,3])_
